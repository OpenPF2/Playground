; Action Traits
; Source: Pathfinder 2E Core Rulebook, Glossary, pages 628-638.
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Action.Auditory",DevComment="Auditory actions rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successful only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Action.Concentrate",DevComment="An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Action.Flourish",DevComment="Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Action.Manipulate",DevComment="You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can't perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Action.Metamagic",DevComment="Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action.

GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Action.Press",DevComment="Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.) Because a press action requires a multiple attack penalty, you can't use one when it's not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Action.Stance",DevComment="A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.")

GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Effect.Poison",DevComment="An effect with this trait delivers a poison or deals poison damage. An item with this trait is poisonous and might cause an affliction.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Effect.Sonic",DevComment="An effect with the sonic trait functions only if it makes sound, meaning it has no effect in an area of silence or in a vacuum.

GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.Disarm",DevComment="A weapon with this trait allows a character to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if the character doesn't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from the character's own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If a character critically fails a check to Disarm using the weapon, they can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.

GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.Forceful",DevComment="A weapon with this trait becomes more dangerous as a character builds momentum. When they attack with it more than once on their turn, the second attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice, and each subsequent attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.FreeHand",DevComment="A weapon with this trait doesn't take up a character's hand, usually because it is built into the character's armor. A free-hand weapon can't be Disarmed. The character can use the hand covered by the free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform manipulate actions, and so on. They can't attack with a free-hand weapon if they're wielding anything in that hand or otherwise using that hand. When they're not wielding anything and not otherwise using the hand, they can use abilities that require them to have a hand free as well as those that require them to be wielding a weapon in that hand.

In addition, while mounted, they can wield the weapon in one hand, changing the damage die to a D6.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.Monk",DevComment="A weapon with this trait monks often learn to use.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.Nonlethal",DevComment="A weapon with this trait often has a nonlethal attack, and is used to knock creatures unconscious instead of kill them. A character can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a â€“2 circumstance penalty.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.Orc",DevComment="A weapon with this trait is crafted and used by Orcs.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.Parry",DevComment="A weapon with this trait can be used defensively to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, if a character's proficiency with it is trained or better, they can spend a single action to position their weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of their next turn.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.Propulsive",DevComment="A ranged weapon with this trait enables a character to add half their Strength modifier (if positive) to damage rolls. If the character has a negative Strength modifier, they add their full Strength modifier instead.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.Reach",DevComment="A weapon with this trait is long and can be used to attack creatures up to 3 meters away instead of only adjacent creatures. For creatures that already have reach with the limb or limbs that wield the weapon, the weapon increases their reach by 1.5 meters.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.Shove",DevComment="A weapon with this trait can be used by a character to Shove with the Athletics skill even if they don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from their own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If they critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, they can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.Sweep",DevComment="A weapon with this trait makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When a character attacks with this weapon, they gain a +1 circumstance bonus to their attack roll if they already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.Thrown.3m",DevComment="A weapon with this trait can be thrown as a ranged attack; it is a ranged weapon when thrown. The character adds their Strength modifier to damage as they would for a melee weapon. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it uses a range increment of 3 meters. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment in the weapon's Range entry.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.Thrown.6m",DevComment="A weapon with this trait can be thrown as a ranged attack; it is a ranged weapon when thrown. The character adds their Strength modifier to damage as they would for a melee weapon. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it uses a range increment of 6 meters. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment in the weapon's Range entry.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.Trip",DevComment="A wrapon with this trait can be used to Trip with the Athletics skill even if the character doesn't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from their own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If they critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, they can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.Twin",DevComment="Two weapons with this trait are used as a pair, complementing each other. When a character attacks with a twin weapon, they add a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to the weapon's number of damage dice if they have previously attacked with a different weapon of the same type this turn. The weapons must be of the same type to benefit from this trait, but they don't need to have the same runes.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.Two-hand.D8",DevComment="A weapon with this trait can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to a D8. This change applies to all the weapon's damage dice, such as those from striking runes.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.Two-hand.D10",DevComment="A weapon with this trait can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to a D10. This change applies to all the weapon's damage dice, such as those from striking runes.")

GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.Unarmed",DevComment="An unarmed attack uses a character's body rather than a manufactured weapon. An unarmed attack isn't a weapon, though it's categorized with weapons for weapon groups, and it might have weapon traits. Since it's part of a character's body, an unarmed attack can't be Disarmed. It also doesn't take up a hand, though a fist or other grasping appendage generally works like a free-hand weapon.")
GameplayTagList=(Tag="Trait.Weapon.Versatile.Bludgeoning",DevComment="A weapon with this trait can be used to deal Bludgeoning (B) damage instead of the type of damage listed in the Damage entry. The character chooses the damage type each time they make an attack.")
